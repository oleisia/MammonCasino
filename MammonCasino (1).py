# Oleisia Johnson, CIS 113 Midterm Project

#Algorithm
#General Setup
  #Import the necessary modules: random and time.
  #Define a function type_text(text, delay) to print text with a typewriter effect.
  #Ask the user if they want to skip the intro dialogue. If they choose not to skip, display the introductory dialogue.

#Game Setup
  #Display the available betting options, ranging from 1 to 7.
  #Create a list named roulette_wheel containing numbers from 1 to 36.
  #Initialize variables: round_counter to 1, winnings to 0, and losses to 0.

#Game Loop
  #Start an infinite loop to keep the game running.
  #Inside the loop, display the current round number.
  #Prompt the user to enter their choice (a number from 1 to 7).

#Check the user's choice:

  #If the choice is 1:
    #Prompt the user to select a number for a straight bet.
    #Check if the selected number is valid (between 1 and 36).
    #Spin the wheel and compare the result to the user's choice.
    #Update winnings and losses accordingly.
  #If the choice is 2:
    #Prompt the user to select a number for a split bet.
    #Check if the selected number is valid.
    #Spin the wheel and compare the result to the user's choice.
    #Update winnings and losses accordingly.
  #If the choice is 3:
    #Prompt the user to select a number for a street bet.
    #Check if the selected number is valid.
    #Spin the wheel and compare the result to the user's choice.
    #Update winnings and losses accordingly.
  #If the choice is 4:
    #Spin the wheel.
    #Check if the result is within the range (1-18).
    #Update winnings and losses accordingly.
  #If the choice is 5:
    #Spin the wheel.
    #Check if the result is within the range (19-36).
    #Update winnings and losses accordingly.
  #If the choice is 6:
    #Prompt the user to choose "Even" or "Odd."
    #Check if the choice is valid.
    #Spin the wheel and compare the result to the user's choice.
    #Update winnings and losses accordingly.
  #If the choice is 7:
    #Display a farewell message and exit the game loop.
    #If the choice is not valid (not in the range 1-7), display an error message.
    #Ask the user if they want to play again (yes/no).

#If the user does not want to play again, exit the game loop.
#Increment the round counter.
#Display a blank line to separate rounds.

#After the game loop, display the user's final soul gem balance.
